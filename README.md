4. **Click "Create pull request"**

### Step 7: Wait for Review ⏳

> **🏆 Important:** Only merged PRs are eligible for certificates!

## 💡 Tips for Contributors

### ✅ Best Practices
- **Keep commits small and focused** - one feature/fix per commit
- **Write clear commit messages** - explain what and why, not just what
- **Test your changes thoroughly** before submitting
- **Follow the existing code style** and structure
- **Read the issue description carefully** before starting work

### 🤔 Need Help?
- **Ask questions in the issue comments** if anything is unclear
- **Check existing PRs** to see examples of good contributions
- **Don't hesitate to ask** - we're here to help you learn!

### 🚫 Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Working on unassigned issues
- Making changes to the main branch directly
- Submitting PRs without testing locally
- Not following the existing code structure
- Including unrelated changes in your PR
